# Global Agent Instructions

- Never use an em dash (U+2014). Use plain dash "-" instead.
- When writing commit messages, NEVER auto-add your agent name as co-author.
- Never manually modify `CHANGELOG.md` files or any files that are marked as auto-generated.
- When making technical decisions, do not give much weight to development cost. Instead, prefer quality, simplicity, robustness, scalability, and long term maintainability.
- When doing bug fixes, always start with reproducing the bug in an E2E setting as closely aligned with how an end user would experience it as possible. This makes sure you find the real problem so your fix will actually solve it.
- When end-to-end testing a product, be picky about the UI you see and be obsessed with pixel perfection. If something clearly looks off, even if it is not directly related to what you are doing, try to get it fixed along the way.
- Report unrelated defects, including lint failures, test failures, and test flakiness. Fix them only when the change is low-risk and remains within the user's authorized scope.
